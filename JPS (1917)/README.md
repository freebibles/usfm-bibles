This is a transcript of the JPS Tanakh 1917 into usfm.

The original PDF of the 1917 Tanakh was created and provided by the Jewish Publication Society (http://www.jewishpub.org/) at the orginal request of the Open Siddur Project (http://opensiddur.org/), and we would like to thank both those organisations for their efforts in supporting and encouraging the freeing of this immensely valuable translation.
